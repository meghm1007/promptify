The Mellowtel library to monetize Chrome Extensions.

Mellowtel allows you to monetize your Chrome Extensions. Fast.

Through the Open-Source library, your users can share a fraction of their unused internet by using a transparent opt-in/out mechanism. Trusted partners — from startups to enterprises — access the internet through the network to scrape publicly available websites and you get a share of the revenue (1000 users —> $200 MRR).
